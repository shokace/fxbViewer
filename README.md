# fxbViewer

.fxb file parser/searcher designed to find specific audio names, returning the sound bank containing desired keyword.

Tired of forgetting where that one synth patch is in Sylenth, but you remember the name? Me too, so I made this. 
It's barebones, but it will show you what file has what synth. 

## Want to improve fxbViewer?

I'm flattered!
